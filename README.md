# Hey there! 👋 I'm Destiny Obueh

I'm a DevOps Engineer who loves building reliable infrastructure, automating workflows, and occasionally writing scripts that make servers behave like well-trained puppies 🐶.

I’m big on systems that **work quietly and scale effortlessly** — from CI/CD pipelines to Dockerized deployments and cloud-native apps. Whether I’m wrangling containers, tuning NGINX configs, or writing a Bash script that fetches port logs from `/var/log`, I’m always thinking *how can this be cleaner, faster, and smarter?*
