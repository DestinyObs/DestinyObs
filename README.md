# Hey there! üëã I‚Äôm Destiny Obueh
DevOps Engineer | Cloud Infrastructure | Automation Enthusiast

I make infrastructure run like clockwork ‚Äî reliable, secure, and a little bit elegant.
I‚Äôve spent the past few years building and maintaining systems that scale gracefully, automating everything from CI/CD pipelines to container orchestration and server monitoring.

When I‚Äôm not scripting servers into submission, I‚Äôm probably tuning a deployment pipeline or breaking down DevOps concepts for others ‚Äî because great systems are nothing without good people who understand them.
